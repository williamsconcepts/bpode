## WHY WE SHOULD KEEP MASTERING AND PRACTICING EVERYDAY.

>If we keep practicing, we gain fluency and basic skills are mastered, allowing us to take on newer and more exciting challenges.

 When we do this, we begin to see connections that were invisible to us before, we slowly gain confidence in our ability to solve problems or overcome weakness through sheer persistence.
 so i urge you to always practice whatever you like everyday and always believe in it, because you never know what it might turn to.
